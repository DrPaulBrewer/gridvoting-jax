## [Unreleased]

### Changed - 2025-12-16

- **Removed pandas dependency**: Eliminated pandas from requirements; replaced `pd.Series().plot()` and `pd.DataFrame()` calls with direct matplotlib plotting
- **Removed scipy dependency**: Eliminated scipy from requirements; replaced `scipy.spatial.distance.cdist` with custom JAX implementations
- **Implemented JAX distance functions**: Added JIT-compiled `dist_sqeuclidean()` and `dist_manhattan()` functions for improved performance
- **Eliminated xp abstraction pattern**: Removed `xp` variable; now use `np` explicitly for NumPy operations and `jnp` explicitly for JAX operations
- **Removed diagnostic plotting code**: Removed power method diagnostics plotting that referenced non-existent attributes
- **Updated Grid methods**: Modified `spatial_utilities()` and `within_disk()` to use JAX distance functions with support for 'sqeuclidean' and 'manhattan' metrics
- **Updated test files**: Removed xp references from all test files; tests now import `jax.numpy as jnp` directly where needed

### Technical Details

- All `xp.asnumpy()` calls replaced with `np.array()`
- Distance calculations now use `@jax.jit` decorator for compilation optimization
- Maintained full backward compatibility - all 22 tests pass
- Verified with NumPy 2.3.5 and JAX 0.4.20+ in isolated Docker environment
