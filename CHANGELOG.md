## [Unreleased]

### Changed - 2025-12-17

- **Grid class fully migrated to JAX arrays**: All Grid properties (`x`, `y`, `points`, `boundary`) now use `jnp.array` instead of `np.array`
- **Removed all assert statements from Grid class**: Eliminated 12 runtime assertions; JAX operations provide natural error handling for shape mismatches
- **Replaced barycentric triangle algorithm with cross-product method**: Implemented simpler, more robust half-plane test for `within_triangle()` using cross products
- **Added `_is_in_triangle_single()` helper function**: JIT-compiled cross-product triangle containment test with epsilon tolerance for edge/vertex cases
- **Vectorized triangle testing**: Used `jax.vmap` to efficiently apply triangle test across all grid points
- **Updated `embedding()` method**: Now uses JAX immutable update pattern (`.at[].set()`) instead of in-place assignment
- **Updated `extremes()` method**: Converted to use `jnp.full` and `jnp.abs` for JAX compatibility
- **Enhanced `plot()` method**: Automatically converts JAX arrays to NumPy for matplotlib compatibility
- **Updated test suite**: Converted test constants to `jnp.array` and replaced `np.testing.assert_array_equal` with `jnp.array_equal`

### Technical Details

- Cross-product algorithm based on [Stack Overflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/2049593/103081) by Kornel Kisielewicz
- Epsilon tolerance of 1e-10 for robust edge/vertex handling in triangle containment
- All Grid methods now return JAX arrays (breaking change from NumPy arrays)
- Functional programming paradigm: no in-place modifications, immutable updates only
- All 22 tests pass (100% success rate)
- Verified with NumPy 2.3.5 and JAX 0.4.20+ in isolated Docker environment

### Changed - 2025-12-16

- **Removed pandas dependency**: Eliminated pandas from requirements; replaced `pd.Series().plot()` and `pd.DataFrame()` calls with direct matplotlib plotting
- **Removed scipy dependency**: Eliminated scipy from requirements; replaced `scipy.spatial.distance.cdist` with custom JAX implementations
- **Implemented JAX distance functions**: Added JIT-compiled `dist_sqeuclidean()` and `dist_manhattan()` functions for improved performance
- **Eliminated xp abstraction pattern**: Removed `xp` variable; now use `np` explicitly for NumPy operations and `jnp` explicitly for JAX operations
- **Removed diagnostic plotting code**: Removed power method diagnostics plotting that referenced non-existent attributes
- **Updated Grid methods**: Modified `spatial_utilities()` and `within_disk()` to use JAX distance functions with support for 'sqeuclidean' and 'manhattan' metrics
- **Updated test files**: Removed xp references from all test files; tests now import `jax.numpy as jnp` directly where needed

### Technical Details

- All `xp.asnumpy()` calls replaced with `np.array()`
- Distance calculations now use `@jax.jit` decorator for compilation optimization
- Maintained full backward compatibility - all 22 tests pass
- Verified with NumPy 2.3.5 and JAX 0.4.20+ in isolated Docker environment
